Everything works except for the win condition. I found this assignment to be very challenging and it took me an unexpectedly long time to complete this. My blank spaces/guessed letters draw vertically rather than horizontally but the logic works. As I was unable to code a win condition, the only way to end the app after winning is to forcibly terminate (ctrl+c).
