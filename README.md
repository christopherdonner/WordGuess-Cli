# WordGuess-Cli

===============================================================================

I successfully have a wordArray of letter objects with a boolean for "guessed" 
per letter object. If all letter objects have a "guessed" value of FALSE, they
are drawn as "_". If I could get the check function to fire correctly, and turn
the letter in question to be guessed=true, this would all work. I know the data
I need is there, but I am having a hard time figuring out how to reference it.
